# Project Background
Moving to New York is a dream move for many of us. Unfortunately its affordability was shattered to pieces with the implementation of the 40x Rent rule, which 
states that renters’ annual salary needs to be 40 times of the monthly rent. With the overwheming popularity of the rule, the goal of the project is to determine 
if an average New Yorker's salary can still afford a room in New York using 
<a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/banking/education/budgeting-saving/how-much-income-should-go-to-rent" target="_blank">Chase’s budgeting guideline</a>
that rent should be no more than 30% of your income.

# Project Execuation
Create a data pipeline by web scraping all the currently available price, bathroom, bedroom, and address data for every rental unit from Rentals.com using Python Selenium library. Then export the data as a csv file for transformation in Microsoft Excel before loading the cleaned data into a MySQL database for visualization in a BI tool. The code showcased on this page will focus on extracting the data, the rest of the project can be found at
