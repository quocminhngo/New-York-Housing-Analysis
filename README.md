# Project Background
Moving to New York is a dream move for many of us. Unfortunately its affordability was shattered to pieces with the implementation of the 40x Rent rule, which 
states that renters’ annual salary needs to be 40 times of the monthly rent. With the overwheming popularity of the rule, the goal of the project is to determine 
if an average New Yorker's salary can still afford a room in New York using 
<a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/banking/education/budgeting-saving/how-much-income-should-go-to-rent" target="_blank">Chase’s budgeting guideline</a>
